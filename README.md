## :ok_hand: Requirements:

- Python 3.5 or above
- PyGame 2
- Neat-Python

## :fire: Usage:

- Clone this repository using: `git clone https://github.com/Trecto34/drive-ai`
- Install the Requirements using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run `python main.py`

## :pencil: Note:

This is the most fun thing I've programmed so far, I love Artificial Intelligence so much and implementing it into a game is so amazing to me, I even managed to learn a little bit about PyGame in the process.
I am thinking of doing something similar only in a Flappy Bird replica, but who knows?
